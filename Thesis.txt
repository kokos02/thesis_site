Title: Requirements and protocol of the 3D documentation of the Heritage Crafts tools


Abstract: This thesis is mainly focused on 3D modeling. It is part of the Mingei project which works on preserving and making heritage crafts available to everyday people. It represents the process of making the 3D representation of the tools used in two heritage crafts, glassblowing and mastic production. Several methods are examined throughout the case studies conducted. The main methods are thorough 3d construction from the beginning, 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry. Other than those, other submethods are also used that are more specific (e.g for textures, nurbs path). The process of using the methods and constructing the tools is step by step explained so any person can do it at home. The results are as close as possible to the real life tools. Each method has its upsides and downsides. The goal is to find the best method for each case study. After that all these objects can be used for 3D videos, virtual reality and augmented reality projects.

	Bevel
	The Bevel tool allows you to create chamfered or rounded corners on geometry. A bevel is an effect that smooths out edges and corners.
	Blob
	A blenders sculpting tool to make a point have a shape of a drop
	Bridge faces
	Usually on a cylinder you select the two edges faces and you delete them (bridge them)
	Chamfer
	In geometry, chamfering or edge-truncation is a topological operator that modifies one polyhedron into another
	Color Gradient
	specifies a range of position-dependent colors
	Color Ramp node
	The Color Ramp Node is used for mapping values to colors with the use of a gradient
	Crop 
	Tool to cut a part of an image you don’t need
	Delete edges
	Delete the selected vertices 
	Displacement node
	The Displacement node is used to displace the surface along the surface normal, to add more detail to the geometry

1. Introduction
This thesis is part of the Mingei project that studies some crafts as cultural heritage. The goal of it is to present the 3D representation of the tools used in glass making and mastic production. It examines several methods of representing the real world in a 3D aspect. The goal is to give everyday people the chance to get in touch with those crafts tools over a tangible representation of their 3D image.
Mingei is a project conducted by several institutes and labs throughout Europe. The aim of it is to explore the possibilities of representing and making accessible both tangible and intangible aspects of craft as cultural heritage to the public. Cultural heritage has significant impact on history and economy of the countries that are found on. It is particularly important to preserve it as it is close to extinction nowadays.
In 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling is the process of making a 3D presentation of an object surface using specialized software. The software used here is Blender. The outcome of each blender project is a 3D model. The creator of those models is called a 3D artist.
Glassblowing is a glass forming technique in which the glassblower inflates molten glass through a blowpipe. He reforms the glass in order to make nice looking shapes. Matic production is the process of making mastic. Mastic is something like a gum that it is produced in Chios which is a Greek island.
In conclusion the goal of this thesis is to represent the tools used on the crafts above. 3D modeling is probably the best way to do it because it’s the most effective way for people to feel those tools.

4.Overview of Approach (Rationale)
This thesis is focused on 3D modeling. All the methods discussed are used widely and there's detailed analysis on each one. The main methods used are shape modeling, 3d laser scanning and photogrammetry. On those methods there are sub methods to modify each shape. All those methods are important in some cases while in some other are useless. So it’s a matter of discussion to find the best method to use and that’s why it’s important to analyze them.
3. Methods




3.1 Geometry reconstruction methods 


3.1.1 Bending method
Most of the times our tools have curvature. In this case you need to use the bending method. To do so you need to separate your shape to at least two parts using usually loop cuts or shapes original vertices. Then select the side you want to bend, point the cursor on the bending point, press shift + w and then move your mouse to the direction you want to bend.

3.1.2 NURBS path method:


Nurbs path method is a really important method for our work. It takes place when you can’t design your shape using the basic shapes that Blender provides. So whenever you see a strange shape that you can’t think of any standard way of making it, nurbs path should come in handy.  To do so you add a curve path and in edit mode move the vertices so it looks like the shape you want to make. Then add another curve, usually a circle to give it thickness (it acts like the circle is spread across the path). After that you add another path and reform it to make the other path fat or slim in specific points and generally do some detailing. After that, you convert your shape to a mesh and your tool is ready.


  

Methodology to add a path

3.1.3 Handle method


Usually handles are shaped like cylinders. We need this method in almost every tool we make so we will make some steps for it. 1) So the first step is to add a cylinder. Most of the times handles are fatter on the begging and then become thinner or the opposite. 2) So we do that either by scaling down one of the edge faces or by adding loop cuts and scaling them up or down for more detailed results. Some handles have curvature. 3)(optional) So if you need to add curvature you add a loop cut at the place you want to make the curve and you bend it by the bending method.  Finally handles are usually made of wood but sometimes also from metals so you have to put texture and normals to make them look realistic. 4) To do that you follow the texture method. Sometimes shapes are weird and you need to make the handle and the rest of it as one shape. In this occasion you do the nurbs path method that you form all the shape as one part. 


  

A handle in edit mode




  Nurbs path with orange and actual shape with white










Apart from the handle the rest of the shape can be in variable shape and are most of the times tricky. You have to think whether there is a ready made shape from blender that you can use it as it is or deform a little bit, or you have to use a lot of shapes and stick them all together to form the desirable shape, or use nurbs path method to create the shape you want to make. 


3.1.4 UV unwrap method:


When you use nurbs path and then you transform it into a mesh, you need first to uv unwrap the shape to start using and modifying the texture. It makes something like a map of vertices over an albedo image which is your texture that represents the shape.You can also use it in a normal shape just to make the texture look even better.

3.1.5 Shape modification with modifiers techniques method:


We usually use some modifiers to give beautiful shape and thickness to our shapes. To do so a modifier we use is the subdivision surface. With this modifier we smooth our shape all around and we take a nice looking result.
  

Shape after using Subdivision surface modifier




Another modifier we use is the solidify. This modifier gives thickness to our shape in a proper manner and we don’t need to do it by hand.




  

Shape after using solidify modifier


3.1.6 Sculpting method:
Sometimes we need to do more ‘artistic’ things to our tools, as the title suggests we want to sculpt them. Sculpting in blender gives us plenty possibilities like drawing, claying, blobbing etc. in a specific part of our mesh. To do so we go to the sculpting tab and select the mode we want to use. Then we use a brush like tool, we have available to sculpt our mesh.


  

Blenders sculpting tab with all its tools and a shape being modified
3.1.7 SVG method


The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) method is a method we don’t prefer but it’s sometimes useful so we have to examine it. When we have a shape that seems strange to us and we have no idea how to construct it using the methods below we use the svg method. To do so you take the image of the shape you want to design and you remove the background (you can use free online tools to do that). Then you convert the image to svg type because that is the type of file that blender accepts. Import the image to blender,transform it to a mesh and then extrude it.
  

An svg image that is being extruded




Best case scenario you will get the exact shape of the tool you wanted to make. But this rarely happens, you will get the shape with sharp, not rounded edges and this is usually unacceptable. Sometimes also the image is not as it actually is but it’s full of dots that you can’t process it, in this case you should convert the image to svg again with another software and try again.




3.2 Texture reconstruction methods
3.2.1 Thorough texture construction


Textures are a vital part of our work. They make our tools look realistic. So every time you should choose a texture (albedo) that seems appropriate for your shape. You also choose a good normal map to make it have the feeling of a real object. If you apply these to things usually you just need to adjust the roughness or use a roughness map along with a color ramp as shown in the picture and the metallic attribute of the object and you have a realistic result. You can add even more attributes but these are the most important. You can try all these things on the shader editor of Blender.

3.2.2 Normal through displacement node
An alternative way to make your tool look realistic that is easier and you don’t need to have separate albeido, normal and roughness maps is by using a displacement node. In this scenario you use your albedo map and a displacement node as shown in the picture below. So you only have to adjust the scale attribute of the displacement and you will make a mesh with realistic feeling.




  

Shader editor with a lot of nodes including displacement on the left and the actual shape on the right


3.2.3 Ready made textures
It also happens sometimes the texture to have built in normals so you don’t need to do anything. You just have to import the texture image to blender.


3.2.4 Texture paint
Sometimes we need to add color to specific points of our tool or even to make the color darker or lighter. On those occasions we use texture paint mode of blender in which we have a brush and we adjust the radius and the strength of it.


  

Texture paint tab on the left and the actual shape being painted on the right


3.2.5 Original texture from photo
Sometimes we can load the image from our prototype and use it’s actual texture on our tool. This can happen if our image is clean, high quality and the tool is laid down on the picture. This way we can achieve really realistic textures.




3.2.6 Isotropic texturing
Sometimes when we apply our textures we have some inequalities and thus differences between each part of our shapes. This usually happens when the parts have variable sizes. In this occasion we have to modify the uv map of every part according to its size. This is is isotropy.


3.2.7 Seamless textures
Sometimes isotropic texturing doesn’t work out. There are still inequalities and the shape looks weird. In this occasion we use seamless textures that are texture that are the same across all the image so we don’t need to scale every part accordingly to have the perfect result.




3.3 3D scanned and photogrammetry methods


3.3.1 Ground removing
All the 3D (Three dimensional) shapes that are being scanned except for the actual shape we want, scan the ground that we don’t need.
  

The result after 3D printing




So we have to remove it in order to modify the 3D shape later. To do so we turn into edit mode and using the select circle tool we select carefully all the vertices around the shape and then we delete the vertices.
  

Select circle tool


  

Marking the ground vertices to remove them






3.3.2 part adding
After removing the ground we end up with a shape that has no bottom, because it wasn’t scanned there. So we need somehow to fill this gap. One way of doing that is by adding a shape (e.g. cube) and fitting it in the hole that is formed.


3.3.3 Duplication
If part adding doesn’t work we can use duplication method. In this case you copy, paste and rotate the shape to fit under the actual shape so it acts as the bottom of the shape. Sometimes we have to scale or generally modify the new part to fit to our shape. This method is not always applicable because top is not always the same as the bottom.
  

Replica of the upper part rotated to use it as ground






3.3.4 Connected parts sculpting


When we connect parts especially when we use the duplication method the result is not so smooth. To fix this we need to use the blenders sculpting tool. This way we smooth the vertices that we connected so they don’t look like two separate parts.


  Sculpting the badly connected part of the shape
3.4 Photogrammetry method


Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs. You put photographs and the output is a 3D model of some real world object. The Software we will use for that is Meshroom in which we give the photos as input and then it does the work in it’s own.


Experiments and case studies
Case study 1 : Kentitiri old
  

3 types of kentitiri with measurement


Methods used:
* SVG method
* Handle method
* Ready made textures
* Normal through displacement node
 




Detailed steps:


1. Crop the above image to leave just the first kentitiri you want to design.
2. Remove the background with a free online tool.
3. Convert the image from png to svg because Blender accepts svg format to be edited after importing.
4. Open blender and import the svg file.
5. Extrude the the shape you imported as much as you want and then transform it to a mesh.
6. Cut the front part of it because it’s the only part we need (to do so mark only the first part in edit mode, press p and then choose selection to separate it from the other part, then just delete the other part.)
  

The way to seperate parts of a shape


7. Scale it in order to match your measurements, and then add a subdivision surface modifier to make it look smoother.
8. Now for the handle. Add a cylinder mesh.
9. Add 3 loop cuts and make it progressively thinner by scaling those parts so it looks like an actual handle.
10. Select the two top faces and bevel them a little bit so it doesn't have so steep edges.  
The procedure of beveling one edge


   11. Now for the texture. Select the front part in object mode, go to the material tab on the right side of the window and press ‘new’, on the base color press the circle and select image texture, then press open and select a metal texture (you can download for free).Modify the metallic and roughness sliders to make the color vivid.
   12. For the handle select the handle in object mode and follow the above instruction with a wood texture this time.
   13. In the end merge the two objects by grabbing them (g button) and the kentitiri is ready.

   3. Separate the cuts from the handle by selecting them and pressing p and selection. Scale them down so it looks deep and give them a black color.
   4. Add a path that is actually a nurbs path and curve it in a way that it looks like the front part of the kentitiri.   
Configuring a nurbs path in edit mode


      5. Add a circle, and then use it as a bevel from the bevel section of the path to make it fat and round.
      6. Add another path and use it as a taper on the geometry tab of the path. This way we can reform the path so it looks exactly like the kentitiri, you just need to modify the new path you added.
      7. Convert your shape to a mesh and then uv unwrap it

Conclusion and future work


This thesis is a detailed step by step research on 3D modeling. It discusses a lot of methods and uses them to construct several 3D models of tools used in heritage crafts.It’s a way to preserve all those crafts but in a modern, elegant and tangible way. People can benefit from this both as get to know 3D arts but also for the general knowledge. The goal is to study every method and be ready to find the best in it’s problem that a 3D artist can face. In the future 3D community has to develop all those methods and if possible find new.
